I currently work at the [Observatoire de Lyon](https://observatoire.univ-lyon1.fr/), preparing a Ph.D. at the [University de Lyon](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/) (69) under the supervision of Philippe Hervé Leloup (research director, CNRS).

My Ph.D. aims to understand the geometry and kinematics of the alpine deformations in the Mont-Blanc/Aiguilles Rouges area. To do so, I use implicit 3D geological modeling and Thermo-kinematic modeling together. More broadly, the objective is to determine the geographical expansion and the geometry of the thrust systems at the external Alps scale. Finally, this research will provide answers on the thickening modes in the external Alps and the mechanical behavior of the orogenic wedges. 
 
Previously, I worked at the [Geoazur](https://geoazur.oca.eu/fr/acc-geoazur) lab in Sophia Antipolis (06) where I contributed to the ANR project [FAULTS-R-GEMS](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE31-0008). I performed high-resolution tectonic mapping on aerial images intended to train a deep learning code to automate the fault and fracture detection. Additionally to that work, I developed numerical tools to analyze the degree of heterogeneity of mapped fault traces. The aim is to examine the relation between the trace heterogeneity of the mapped faults and the degree of structural maturity. Indeed, this property is highly determinant because it controls the behavior of the seismic rupture. 

Before that, I have done my Master's degree in physics and chemistry of the Earth and planets at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon and the University Claude Bernard Lyon-1. My master thesis has been part of the [RGF project "Alpes et bassins périphériques"](http://rgf.brgm.fr/page/alpes-bassins-peripheriques), founded by the French geological survey (BRGM), specializing in 3D geological modeling, structural geology, and tectonics.
