I currently work at the [Observatoire de Lyon](https://observatoire.univ-lyon1.fr/), preparing a PhD at the [University de Lyon](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/). 
My work focuses on the alpine deformation during the 

Before that, I worked at the [Geoazur](https://geoazur.oca.eu/fr/acc-geoazur) lab where I contributed to the ANR projetc Faults-R-Gems. I performed high-resolution tectonic mapping on aerial images intended to train a deep learning code for automate the fault and fracture detection. Aditionnaly to that work, I developped numerical tools to conduct analysis on the degree of heterogeneity of mapped fault traces. The aims is to see if there is a relation between the heterogenity of the mapped faults and the degree of structural maturity of the faults. This property is highly important because it controls the behaviour of the seismic rupture. 

Previously, I have done my Master degree in physics and chemistry of the Earth and planets at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon and the University Claude Bernard Lyon-1. My master thesis has been part of the RGF project, founded by the french geological survey (BRGM), specializing in 3D geological modeling, structural geology and tectonics.
