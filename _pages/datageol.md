DataGeol is a database that allows to organize, store, and use geological data efficiently. Upon returning from a field mission, the user can enter the information he has noted in his field notebook in different dedicated tables (location, observations, samples, etc.). The different tables are organized and linked together, allowing data to be exported in different formats for processing or display. The database is formatted in Structured Query Langage (SQL), which is a programming language specifically designed for managing data held in a database. Basically the data are organized into several tables. Each row is called a record and each column is a field. The field is a single item of information that describes the content of the column.
