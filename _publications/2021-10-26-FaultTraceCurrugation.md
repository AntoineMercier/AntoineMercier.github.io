### Abstract ###
As faults grow over time and become more “mature,” some of their geometrical and
mechanical properties evolve, and these changes modify earthquake behavior. It is thus of prime
importance to know the degree of structural maturity of a fault that is likely to produce large earthquakes.
Although this concept is extensively used, there is no common definition or metric to measure the
structural maturity of a fault. We analyzed the heterogeneity of the surface traces of 13 large seismogenic
faults whose maturity is known qualitatively. We measured the corrugations and step-over segmentation
of the traces from ∼100 m to the fault length scale. Corrugations and some properties of the segmentation
are found to vary with fault structural maturity. We provide scaling relationships that quantify the
structural maturity of a fault based on its surface trace. These results should help in parameterizing source
faults in earthquake models.

### Plain language summary ### 
Long-term faults produce earthquakes. Measuring fault
properties could thus help us understand earthquake behavior. However, measuring properties of largescale
faults in particular is difficult. Here, we tackle one of the major long-term properties of faults,
their structural maturity. This property relates to the overall slip longevity of the fault (generally several
million years), and it has been shown to impact earthquake behavior; mature and immature faults do not
behave similarly. For 13 large seismogenic continental faults whose structural maturity was estimated
qualitatively in earlier works, we examined the heterogeneity of the traces these faults form at the ground
surface. Using simple tools, we measured the undulations and the discrete “stepping” segmentation of
the fault traces over a broad range of scales from ∼100 m to the full fault length (up to ∼1,600 km in this
study). We found that the “intensity” of undulations and the density, relative width, and size diversity
of the steps separating discrete fault segments all vary with the structural maturity of the faults. These
variations are described with simple mathematical functions that characterize fault structural maturity
and can be used to better represent source faults in earthquake models.
