New 3D structural data from the Chamonix synclinorium, in between the Aiguilles Rouges and the Mont-Blanc external ranges of the Alps, allow deciphering the area structural history: the Mesozoic sedimentary cover has been thrust at least 10km NW above the Helvetic Basal DÃ©collement (HBD) before to be offset by late steep thrusts during exhumation in the Miocene. The HBD roots east of the Mont-Blanc on the older Penninic thrust. Such interpretation fundamentally diverges from the classical view of the sedimentary cover of the Chamonix synclinorium being expulsed from a former graben during a single deformation phase and implies that a major ~10 Ma long thrust phase has been overlooked. The HBD extends below most of the subalpine ranges and emerges in front of the Bauges and within the Chartreuse and Vercors massifs implying that the major alpine basal thrust was rooted east of the External Crystalline Massifs until 20 to 15 Ma.
